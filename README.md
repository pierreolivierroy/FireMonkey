**== Team Introduction ==**

We are 3 students in software engineering with a passion for video game development. 
While this is our first GCA entry as a team, we participated to GCA2 and GCA3 with other teams. 
This year, we focused on the aesthetics and the gameplay of our game and as always we aimed for a game that's fun to play and meets current mobile game trends. 

**== Game Concept ==**

You are a little monkey trying to make its way to space. You start on a remote beach of a fantasy island and have to get to the space rocket through the jungle and a snowy mountain. 

To get more points your monkey as to survive as long as possible. The game is over when your monkey reaches the bottom of the screen. To avoid that you have to either get bananas, get in a barrel or use one of your limited rocket boost. 

There's a quick game mode where the goal is to get as many points as possible. 

There's a campaign mode where you have to reach X points to unlock the next level.
Each level is more difficult than the previous one.
** All levels are unlocked with this release for demo purposes **

In both modes, points are calculated with a mix of the number of bananas you get, the height of the player and successful bonuses. 

The highscore for each level is saved to showoff to your friends! 

**== Gameplay ==**

To start a game press anywhere on the screen when you see the "Ready!" text.

Tilt your device sideways to change the position (left/right) of your monkey. 

You have 3 ways to stay alive:
1. Get bananas. The bigger the banana, the further you'll go. 
2. Get in barrels. When you enter a barrel a sequence of numbers will appear on screen. You have X seconds to click the numbers in order to get a bonus rocket jump and some extra points. If you miss any numbers or don't press them in the good order you'll be slowed down. 
3. Use a rocket jump. At any point in the game you can click anywhere on the screen to use one of your rocket jumps. The number of remaining jumps available is displayed on the bottom right corner of the screen. Use them only when really needed. 

The game is over when your monkey reaches the bottom of your screen.

**== What's next? ==**

We see great potential in this game as there are many things that could be added to make it more fun. More bonuses and challenges like the barrel challenge would make the game even more addictive. More levels and scenarios would also be fun.  

As it is the game could be a great success for many reasons. Currently it takes about 2-3 minutes to die which is what most mobile gamers expect. The game is fun, addictive and you get better after each game which makes you want to play again.
